# Gin Rummy Scorekeeper

The purpose of the project is to provide players the ability to play Gin Rummy without the need for making mental and hand calculations. This is a python module that automatically computates the score for a variation of Gin Rummy. 

## Getting Started and Installation

This program requires Python 2.7 and the Gin Rummy repository zip file. You can find the download for Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Windows is the recommended OS. Unzip file and open the file new_gin_keeper.py. Common rules for Gin Rummy can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy.

## Testing and Use

To increase or decrease the font size, style, etc., right click the command title bar and select 'Properties'. Then select the 'Font' tab and make any changes as necessary. Use integers when prompted with number responses. The program will fail if an input doesn't match the requested answer type.
